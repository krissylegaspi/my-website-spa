    Ever since the school year has started, I have not had much time to spend with my housemates. We decided to take a study break from midterms by hiking to the top of Mt. Rubidoux to watch the sunrise.

    The hike was very enjoyable. I love morning hikes! Watching the sun rise is definitely one of the things I look forward to when hiking. As a California resident, my favorite sunrise and sunset spots are hiking areas and, of course, the beach. The crips air while relaxing after a tiresome adventure up... is just exhilarating. It is such a wonderful and breathtaking experience to watch how time moves from this perspective. It is really worth the miles of hiking and waking up at 5 AM!
