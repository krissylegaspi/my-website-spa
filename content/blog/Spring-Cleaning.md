    Spring has arrived and I am excited because this is my favorite season. I love watching the leaves grow back, the flowers bloom, and the warm sun kissing my skin. I am ready! A year has passed since the pandemic and a lot has changed.
</p>
<p>
    I have also noticed that I write more during this season. I have a blog post during March of each year. Maybe it's because it's my favorite season. Or maybe that I take this opportunity to reflect. Longer days are ahead of us and this is the time to see how we have done so far since the beginning of the year.

    Lately, I have been more motivated to work on more projects, apply to more jobs/internships, and to strive towards my career. I don't know why or how but I am excited.
