    I started my juicing journey!
</p>

<p>
    I am very excited. Upon weeks of research, I wanted to have the best experience. I knew that a masticating juicer is what I would want ultimately because I am serious about juicing. Instead of buying a cheap centrifugal juicer, I decided to go all out and purchase an investment that will last me for a while!
</p>

<p>
    My first juice consisted of: (2) apples, (2) handful of spinach, (2) carrots, (4) celery sticks, (2) cucumber. I am not the biggest fan of celery... but to my surprise, it was delicious! The carrots and apples really brought out the sweetness. Since the fruits and vegetables were refrigerated, the juice came out cold and ready to drink! I am absolutely a big fan of the masticating juicer. Cold pressed juicing is a newfound addition to living a healthier lifestyle.

<p>
    In a few days or so, I plan on doing a juice cleanse. I just need to plan and make sure I have all the ingredients I will need... because I will need lots!
</p>

<p>
    I am super happy and I know this will be life changing!
