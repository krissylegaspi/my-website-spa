    If there is one thing I would like to tell young people is this: try to have at least one permanent fixture in your life that you can control. It is very easy to realize that we are “too mature” to do this or that - but believe me, there’s a chance you’ll be overwhelmed with changes when you become an adult. That one thing will remind you of who you were, and the familiarity it brings will anchor you when life changes become too strong. There are things that should be let go of, but there are those that should stay.
