    Somewhere in the world tonight there is no fighting. Somewhere in the world tonight, there is no crying, there is no fear. Somewhere in the world tonight, someone is holding their first child, someone else is falling in love for the first time. Somewhere in the world tonight, everything is alright. And tonight, in this tiny corner that I occupy in this big wide space called Earth, I’m thinking of you… and because of my memory of you, somewhere in my world tonight, everything is alright.

    Time does not wait for anyone or anything. Time does not hesitate. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. Time keeps going, it never stops. Time sure knows how to say “NO!” I’ve learnt from Time that no matter what has happened, is happening, or will happen, I must “Keep moving forward,” and that I must go forward, no matter how much I love looking back.

    Time is a precious commodity, but do we really value it or give it the sense of respect it deserves? Time, though sometimes may appear to be selfish as it leads the race, leaving us torn between the past and the present, finding it hard to trudge along to the future–Time sure does heal us all. That’s the beauty about Time. That’s the kindest quality about Time. That’s what we all need so very much. A Time to heal. And that Time can only come with time. How ironic! The past is the skeleton that Time left behind. The present is Time’s new avatar. The future is Time’s surety of reincarnation. But in all three forms of progression of Time’s soul, we are being taught the beautiful lesson of learning from our experiences, therefore, Healing. And that can only come from “reminiscing” without attachment.

    Memory is Time’s offspring. Time leaves us with its product that we can not kill and nobody can snatch from us either, no matter how far we have travelled with Time itself. Some memories may bring you pain, some others solace. Either way, your Memory is your richest possession; your mind is your most beautiful accessory. For if not for memories, it would not have occurred to me that a post is one of my favorite places on Earth is overdue. I’m here today because Time’s child Memory ushered me to you. Sweet memories of you happen to meet me today and remind me that there is a lovely bunch of people waiting to read me, wanting to hear from me, wondering how I am, thinking of me, all because of Time’s child that lived inside of you, too. Memories, they make us who we are.

    I hope you are all doing well. I have not forgotten you, for my Memory shall always bring me back to you. Merry Christmas and a very happy New Year to you all! Life is going great for me and I hope all is well with you too! Thank you for all the wishes, thoughts, notes, e-mails, messages, and most of all, for the endless love.

    Value, respect, love, and appreciate Time. For Time is where we all live forever, be it in the past, present, or future; not anywhere else. Time is where we breathe, where we can truly reconnect, where we can undoubtedly go back to our loved ones, where fresh moments are born and where they continue to live. Time is where we exist - we “live” in a blob of Time that once used to be, is, and will always be. I believe there is a “place” where we can wave goodbye to our fears and tears–at least for a while; Moments, Memory, Time.

    Two-thousand fourteen is at birth… reincarnation of two-thousand thirteen (and of many years that were its past lives). Have a wonderful “Time,” create beautiful “Memories,” and don’t forget to be inspired by Time and “Keep going forward!”
