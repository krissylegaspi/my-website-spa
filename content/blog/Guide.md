<p>Whatever you do, do it with purpose.

    "You will always be too much of something for someone: too big, too loud, too soft, too edgy. If you round out your edges, you lose your edge. Apologize for mistakes. Apologize for unintentionally hurting someone — profusely. But don’t apologize for being who you are." - Danielle LaPorte
</p>
<p>
    If you want to say "thank you", don't say "sorry." If you want to say "thank you for your patience," don't say "sorry I'm always late." If you want to say "thank you for understanding me," don't say "sorry I'm not making a lot of sense." If you want to say "thank you for spending time with me," don't say "sorry I'm kind of a drag." If you want to say "thank you for listening," don't say "sorry I'm just rambling." If you want to say "thank you for appreciating me," don't say "sorry I take up so much space." If you want to say "thank you for having hope in me this whole time," don't say "sorry I'm such a disappointment." Appreciate the others for what they have already done. Whether they know it or not. Don't apologize for simply existing. Because it is not wrong. If you want to say thank you, don't say sorry.

    Being a good communicator means being a good listener.

    "Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years." - Bill Gates

    "You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with." - Jim Rohn
</p>
<p>
    "Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and they will come forth later in uglier ways." - Sigmund Freud
</p>
<p>
    "If you obsess over whether you are making the right decision, you are basically assuming that the universe will reward you for one thing and punish you for another.
</p>
<p>
    The universe has no fixed agenda. Once you make any decision, it works around that decision. There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling, and action that you experience." - Deepak Chopra

    There is a time and a place for everything.

<p>
    80/20 rule.
</p>
<p>
    Say what you mean and mean what you say.

    “Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
<p>
    "Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that." - Martin Luther King Jr.
</p>
<p>
    "If you love a flower, don't pick it up. Because if you pick it up, it dies and it ceases to be what you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession. Love is about appreciation." - Osho

    All the effort you are making will ultimately pay off.
