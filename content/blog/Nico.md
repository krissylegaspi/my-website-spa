    I took my puppy, Nico, to the dog beach today! In the beginning, I was worried about having him go out in public because he will probably eat everything! But thankfully, he didn't! I wanted him to be exposed to larger dogs and socialize with the big guys so he can develop his social skills. He enjoyed it as much as I did - if not more! Here are some pictures of him playing around!
